## Godot 4.7 Baseline

- Patterns assume **Godot 4.7+** projects; prefer `.tres` / Resources as the extract truth layer (Godot 4.x Resource pipelines).

# Monte Carlo Game Balancer

Build a **bespoke, source-driven Monte Carlo balance lab** for one game — not a prebuilt tool. Reference architecture: Rust CLI + rayon that extracts `GameData`, simulates imperfect humans, verdicts with CIs, tunes by simulation, and calibrates against headless Godot.

**Always Phase 0 first.** Lane-defense field names are **not** the default model.

## The Iron Law: Source-Extracted, Zero Config

No hand-copied numbers in the sim. Parse Resources / source at startup so the next run reflects designer edits.

## Abstract Model (mandatory Phase 0)

| Abstraction | Meaning | If absent |
|-------------|---------|-----------|
| Session | Bounded attempt | — |
| Threat | Pressure toward fail | delete |
| Defense / agency | Player levers | delete |
| Faults | Attention taxes | delete |
| Resources | Consumable flow | delete |
| In-run economy | Session spend | delete |
| Meta economy | Shop / unlocks / prestige | delete |
| Grade | Stars / rank / time / score | delete |

Write `BALANCE_PLAN.md`. Simulate only mapped rows.

## Progressive disclosure

> **MANDATORY**: Read the linked reference before implementing that phase.
>
> **Do NOT Load**:
> - `example-lane-defense.md` — unless Phase 0 maps to lane-defense / shift TD
> - `06-genre-adaptation.md` — unless genre ≠ default PvE win%-band session
> - `07-godot-calibration.md` — only when starting calibration **or** Phase 0 did **not** waive physics/AI (waiver = fully formulaic math-only game, documented in `BALANCE_PLAN.md`)

### Phase 0 — Audit → [references/00-game-audit.md](references/00-game-audit.md)
Genre, win/fail, modes, catalog, influence graph, economy, styles + **primary metric**, extraction plan. Confirm with designer.

### Phase 1 — Extract → [references/01-source-extraction.md](references/01-source-extraction.md)
Resource-first decision tree; `inspect` before any simulate.

### Phase 2 — Sim → [references/02-simulation-engine.md](references/02-simulation-engine.md)
Behavioral `PlayStyle` × `InputModel` (mouse/touch/gamepad), `SessionModel` for mobile, seeded `SmallRng`, rayon over independent jobs.

### Phase 3 — Analyze → [references/03-analysis-reporting.md](references/03-analysis-reporting.md)
Wilson/bootstrap CI verdicts; secondary agency checks; stable JSON.

### Phase 4 — Economy → [references/04-economy-retention.md](references/04-economy-retention.md)
Careers, farms, interest curve, reward-cadence checkpoints.

### Phase 5 — Tune → [references/05-tuning-generation.md](references/05-tuning-generation.md)
Band-scored bruteforce; emit `.tres` when the project is Resource-first.

### Phase 6 — Genre → [references/06-genre-adaptation.md](references/06-genre-adaptation.md)
Metric overrides + Domain Skill chains.

### Phase 7 — Calibrate → [references/07-godot-calibration.md](references/07-godot-calibration.md)
3–5 golden cells vs headless Godot before full-matrix sign-off (unless waived).

## Bundled Resources

Canonical layout after copy:

```text
tools/
  balance_lab.ps1          # from launcher.ps1
  balance_lab.sh           # from launcher.sh
  balance_lab/
    Cargo.toml
    src/main.rs            # clap stubs — expand per Phase 0
```

### [scripts/balance-lab-template/](scripts/balance-lab-template/)
Copy `Cargo.toml` + `src/` into `tools/balance_lab/`. Place launchers as `tools/balance_lab.ps1` / `tools/balance_lab.sh` (siblings of the crate dir).

### [scripts/compare_balance_snapshots.py](scripts/compare_balance_snapshots.py)
CI-aware snapshot diff.

### [references/json-schema.md](references/json-schema.md)
Stable `--json` field contract.

## CLI Contract

```text
balance-lab inspect
balance-lab simulate --level 3 --style average --runs 1000
balance-lab career --style casual --runs 200
balance-lab mode <key> --runs 500
balance-lab bruteforce --level 4 ...
balance-lab gen-level ...
balance-lab calibrate --cells golden.json
balance-lab --json <any command>
balance-lab --seed 42 <any command>
```

## Target Bands (default; Phase 0 overrides)

Bands are defined per `style × input_model` cell. Default input model is `mouse`.

| Style   | Input | Win-rate target | Below → | Above → |
|---------|-------|-----------------|---------|---------|
| afk     | mouse | 5% – 55%        | TOO HARD | TOO EASY |
| casual  | mouse | 55% – 90%       | TOO HARD | TOO EASY |
| average | mouse | 70% – 95%       | TOO HARD | TOO EASY |
| pro     | mouse | 90% – 100%      | TOO HARD | — |
| afk     | touch | 5% – 55%        | TOO HARD | TOO EASY |
| casual  | touch | 55% – 90%       | TOO HARD | TOO EASY |
| average | touch | 65% – 92%       | TOO HARD | TOO EASY |
| pro     | touch | 85% – 100%      | TOO HARD | — |

A level is only OK when every simulated `style × input_model` cell lands inside its band. Difficulty must come from the level curve, not from punishing input speed alone.

> **Platform Rule**: If the game ships on mobile, the matrix MUST include touch input models. A level that is OK on mouse but TOO HARD on touch is TOO HARD.

### CI verdict law (single source of truth)

| Mode | Runs/cell | `OK` rule |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| Search / working | 100–300 | 95% CI **overlaps** band; else TOO_HARD / TOO_EASY / INCONCLUSIVE |
| Sign-off / DoD / snapshot | ≥1000 | 95% CI **fully ⊆** band for **every** style × shipped input model |

Fighting / educational / idle often replace win% — set primary metric in Phase 0.

## NEVER Do

### Data & Extraction
- **NEVER hardcode game numbers or skip existing Resources / `.tres`** — hand copies rot into false conclusions; regex farms on Resource projects fight the data layer. Resource-first; regex only for inline formula coefficients. Flag every `(default!)` in `inspect` before the first simulate.
- **NEVER skip embedded formulas** — extract coefficients; one reimplementation in sim. Shape change must fail the regex loudly.

### Simulation Fidelity
- **NEVER simulate only optimal play** — a pro-only PASS ships an unplayable floor; AFK/casual failures are the bug players feel.
- **NEVER model humans as instantaneous** — zero-delay agents clear jam/fault windows real players miss; difficulty collapses into twitch gates.
- **NEVER reuse desktop reaction/tap parameters for mobile** — touch has lower taps/sec, higher miss chance, and occlusion; balancing against mouse numbers ships an unplayable mobile game.
- **NEVER assume uninterrupted sessions on mobile** — model interruptions (notifications, app switching) and session-length caps; a level requiring 12 minutes of unbroken attention fails the platform.
- **NEVER let precision-dependent mechanics go untested on touch** — any mechanic requiring accurate/fast pointing must be simulated with the touch accuracy model before sign-off.
- **NEVER skip meta-game** — omit shop/upgrades/modes/replay → “balanced” sessions with broken careers.
- **NEVER use unseeded or `HashMap`-hashed seed paths** — default hasher is process-randomized → false CI diffs across machines/rayon schedules; use `seed_for` + stable hash; unit-test determinism.
- **NEVER share `RunState`/RNG across rayon jobs** — cross-talk masquerades as balance noise and breaks reproducibility.
- **NEVER claim mathematical balance from an uncalibrated physics/AI model** — Phase 7 or documented waiver; abstract DPS ≠ Godot collisions.

### Judging Balance
- **NEVER judge by a single average** — histograms, downtime, failure-by-kind, resource ratios hide coin-flips vs skill cliffs.
- **NEVER verdict on point estimates alone** — CI law (search overlap / sign-off ⊆); ≥300 search, ≥1000 sign-off.
- **NEVER declare winnable without resource-flow checks** — pressure AND income vs consumption (classic starved-but-“beatable” bug).
- **NEVER balance difficulty and economy separately** — clear-time changes currency/minute; re-run careers after difficulty edits.
- **NEVER over-nerf a farm without re-checking shop reachability** — post-exploit patches often strand the ladder.
- **NEVER balance PvP with sole AFK→pro PvE bands** — matchup / MMR metrics.

### Tuning & Maintenance
- **NEVER tune one session in isolation** — full matrix + career after changes.
- **NEVER accept generated content without sim validation**.
- **NEVER emit `.gd` factories into a Resource-first project** — emit `.tres` / Resource shape.
- **NEVER cache `GameData` across game-source edits**.
- **NEVER make designers compile manually** — self-rebuilding launchers; stale binaries → stale conclusions.
- **NEVER stdout-only for agents** — `--json` + `game_data_hash`.

## Golden path (first engagement)

1. Phase 0 → `BALANCE_PLAN.md` + designer lock on bands/metrics.
2. Phase 1 extract → **`inspect`** → if unexpected `(default!)`, stop and fix extract ([example-lane-defense.md](references/example-lane-defense.md) smell).
3. Phase 2–3: one cell at 300 runs (Search overlap) → full matrix → SignOff ⊆ at 1000.
4. Phase 4 career → farm/shop flags → Phase 7 calibrate (unless waived) → snapshot JSON.

## Definition of Done

1. `inspect` verified; no unexpected `(default!)`.
2. Seed-determinism test passes.
3. Phase 7 PASS (or Phase 0 waiver recorded).
4. Full matrix (all levels × all styles × all shipped input models, ≥1000 runs/cell) — every cell **CI ⊆ band** (sign-off law).
5. Modes + career: currency/minute OK; no dominant farm; shop reachable.
6. Interest curve + reward-cadence checkpoints PASS.
7. Regression JSON snapshot committed for CI.
